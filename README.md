# Portfolio Backend

This is the backend service for the **e-portfolio** project, built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. It provides APIs to handle contact form submissions, integrates with **AWS SES** for email functionality, and is deployed on **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** with a CI/CD pipeline configured via **AWS CodePipeline**.

---

## Features

- **Contact Form API**:
  - Accepts `name`, `email`, `subject`, and `message`.
  - Sends emails using **AWS SES**.
- **Health Check Endpoint**:
  - Endpoint to verify application status.
- **CORS Configuration**:
  - Allows secure API access across origins.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Fully automated pipeline for seamless deployment from GitHub to Elastic Beanstalk.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs.
- **AWS SES**: Simple Email Service for email integration.
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: For application hosting.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: For continuous integration and deployment.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed.
- AWS account with **SES**, **Elastic Beanstalk**, and **CodePipeline** access.

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devwithmehar/portfolio-backend.git
   cd portfolio-backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

     ```bash
     npm install
   ```
3. Configure environment variables: Create a .env file in the project root with the following:

    ```bash
    AWS_REGION=your-aws-region
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key-id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-access-key
    AWS_SENDER=your-sender-email
    PORT=8081

   ```
4. Start the development server:

  ```bash
     npm run dev
   ```
5. Access the API:

- Health check: ```bash http://localhost:8081/health ```
- Contact API:  ```bash http://localhost:8081/contact ```

## Deployment

### Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk

1. Prepare for Deployment:

- Ensure the app runs with pm2 for production:
```bash
     npm start
   ```
2. Deploy to Elastic Beanstalk:

- Create an Elastic Beanstalk application and upload the code zip file.

3. CI/CD with AWS CodePipeline:

 Set up CodePipeline with: 

 - **Source** : GitHub repository.
 - **Build**: Skipped (Node.js doesnâ€™t require a build step).
 - **Deploy**: Elastic Beanstalk integration.
